We design and implement the workflows, automations, and integrations that power the employee lifecycle, access, ITIL processes, and core business systems, partnering closely with Security and cross-functional teams to deliver solutions that work end to end.\nOur mandate spans solution design, system implementation, workflow engineering, automation, and the reliability of the platforms behind employee-facing processes. We work closely with Support to resolve complex issues, refine workflows, and ensure our solutions perform reliably in real-world conditions. We turn operational problems into scalable, engineered systems that reduce friction, codify patterns, and help OpenAI grow predictably and securely.\n\nAbout the Role\nAs a Solutions Engineer, you will design and implement scalable, ITIL-aligned workflows using OpenAI technology and models to automate and improve core IT processes. You will deliver cross-functional solutions from requirements and architecture through build, rollout, and operationalization across ITSM, IAM, SaaS platforms, identity-adjacent systems, lifecycle automation, access workflows, integrations, and enterprise orchestration.\nYou will reduce operational toil by building durable automations that ensure systems behave consistently, predictably, and securely. You will also work closely with IT Support Operations to eliminate root causes, streamline workflows, and equip Support with the least-privilege access needed to operate effectively.\nThis is an on-site role based in our San Francisco office with a minimum presence of three days per week.\n\nIn this role, you will:\nSolution Design and Implementation\nTranslate unclear requirements into structured workflows and dependable systems.\n\nBuild integrations across identity, SaaS, ITSM, internal applications, and endpoints.\n\nDeliver implementations from architecture through rollout and documentation.\n\nSupport Partnership\nAddress recurring issues with targeted workflow and system improvements.\n\nEquip Support with training, Playbooks, and long-term administrative patterns.\n\nManage on-call rotations and technical escalations across IT and Security.\n\nWorkflow, Automation, and Orchestration\nBuild automated request flows across Slack, ChatGPT, Atlas, Jira, Linear, Incident.io, and Retool.\n\nUse APIs, Terraform, scripting, and low-code tools to remove manual effort.\n\nITIL Application and Management\nMaintain Incident, Request, Change, and Problem workflows across modern ITSM tools.\n\nProvide repeatable workflow templates for teams across the company.\n\nIntegrations\nExecute user, device, and SaaS integration playbooks.\n\nLead identity, access, and ITSM migrations during acquisitions.\n\nSystem Administration\nMaintain lifecycle, collaboration, and automation platforms such as Slack Grid, Google Workspace, Atlassian, and GitHub.\n\nEnsure system reliability through monitoring, logging, workflow health, and integration upkeep.\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\nInstinctively break down messy, ambiguous processes and turn them into clear, logical, well-structured systems.\n\nNavigate technical and non-technical teams with ease, translating needs and aligning stakeholders without friction.\n\nIdentify patterns, eliminate repetition, and design solutions that scale rather than relying on manual effort.\n\nUnderstand identity as a foundation of enterprise architecture and think holistically about trust, entitlements, and lifecycle flows.\n\nAdapt quickly to new tools, understand how systems fit together, and enjoy learning the inner workings of enterprise platforms.\n\nThink in systems naturally and identify where data or workflows break down, and design clean, resilient cross-system connections.\n\nYou appreciate structured frameworks like ITIL and Agile, using them to bring order, predictability, and continuous improvement.\n\nYou communicate clearly through runbooks and written guidance that help others move faster and reduce institutional knowledge gaps.\n\nAbout OpenAI\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.
