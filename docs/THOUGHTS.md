- HAVE TO HAVE ELEMENTARY UNDERSTANDING OF CODING AND INFRA TO MAKE THIS EFFICIENT (IE IDENTIFIED DOCKER SOCKET ERRORS, editing bash, understanding network errors ETC)
- Have to start multple chats with efficient handoff and way to upload entire repo as hallucinations start relatively quickly on chatgpt 5.x
- model is not naturally inclined to let you cross check with other models and will make snarky remarks; you have to push this
- due to massive hallucinations, you have to establish roadmap and standard pm principles early and uphold them (dont go in circles, frequently heck against roadmap, refine etc)
- sticking to sprints is massive burden for solo project as context drift makes it completely unreliable to rely on model for it
- example of context drift is readme which quickly becomes jumble
- codex is incredilby good at followoing instructions but can be very verbose in the amoutn fo code it writes
- opus and sonent seem more surgical, whilst still verbose, but terribl e at following instructions ansd wild token usage
- codex model of AI usage makes vibe coding accessible for almost anyone
- a lot of the work is just jockeying outputs and prompts between codex and chatgpt, BUT having prompt knowledge with chatgpt is impotant as it can easily start to drift from the strict chatgpt<>codex workflow if not kept on strict guardrails










personal to-do
- redo readme
- come up with name, keep core engine name JIE
- look at orchestration via rancher before introducing other apps (maybe this is a new chat?)
- think about open source licensing 
- think about website set up and landing page for apps
- switch domain to .com from .net
