# Legal Positioning

SignalCraft is a discovery and alerting layer for career opportunities. It is designed to help users identify relevant roles quickly and route back to original employer sources.

## Positioning

- Discovery layer, not a replacement for employer career pages.
- Intelligence and prioritization product, not a job-board mirror.
- Built for transparent provenance, policy-aware collection, and deterministic operations.

## Compliance and Ethics Principles

- Respect robots and site policy decisions configured in provider controls.
- Apply politeness controls (rate limits, concurrency caps, backoff/circuit breaker behavior).
- Do not bypass paywalls or attempt CAPTCHA circumvention.
- Preserve source attribution and canonical outbound links.

## Operational Posture

- Treat source pages as the system of record.
- Preserve provenance so policy and scrape decisions are auditable.
- Keep outputs explainable and evidence-backed via run artifacts.
