---This project is called Job Intelligence Engine (JIE). It is a modular Python 3.9 codebase using a .venv virtual environment located at the project root.

Key architectural conventions:
- All source code lives under src/ji_engine/.
- Providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) must inherit from BaseJobProvider in providers/base.py.
- ScraperManager in scraper.py functions ONLY as an orchestrator and should not contain scraping logic.
- The scraping flow is SNAPSHOT-first, LIVE-second. Do not remove snapshot mode.
- RawJobPosting (models.py) is the provider output for Sprint 1. Higher-level Pydantic models may wrap it later.
- data/ contains snapshots, intermediate JSON, and candidate_profile.json.
- Maintain clean imports using the src directory as PYTHONPATH.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies; prefer stdlib unless a library is explicitly approved.

AI should follow:
- Clean, modular design.
- Type hints everywhere.
- Functions should be short, testable, and separated by responsibility.
- Never rewrite architecture without explicit instruction.
- Never delete snapshot logic or the RawJobPosting model.

This rule defines the project's ground truth. When modifying files, follow these conventions.
